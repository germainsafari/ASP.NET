Suppose a farmer is planning to grow cabbages on his land. The cost of growing
cabbages is £50 per acre and he earns £100 from the produce in the market. There
is another option for him, to grow pumpkins, which could yield him £110 if he
spent £70 on it. (a) What is the opportunity cost of growing cabbages? Is it
rational for the farmer to grow cabbages instead of pumpkins? (c) Suppose the
only other option for him to earn from his farmland is to rent it to another farmer.
